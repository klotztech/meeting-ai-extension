# Icons Folder

Place your extension icons here:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Quick Icon Creation

You can create simple icons using:
1. Online tools: https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Image editors (GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
3. Any simple microphone or recording icon

For testing, you can use any PNG images temporarily. The extension will work, but Chrome may show a default icon if these are missing.
